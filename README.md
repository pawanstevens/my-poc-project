# Employee Management System
It is a full stack java project. Front-end part of the project is developed with the help of ReactJS, ViteJs, Bootstrap CSS, Javascript and Axios. Back-end part of the project is developed with the help of Spring Boot 3, Spring Data JPA, MySQL Databse.


### Front-End
Front-End provides high-quality GUI experience so that you can perform add,list, update and delete operations for both employees and departments.


### Back-End
At the back-end side I have developed REST API's to perform CRUD operations on both Employees and Departments section.

### Usage
